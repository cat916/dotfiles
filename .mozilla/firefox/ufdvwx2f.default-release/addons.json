Use it to hide your real email address and protect yourself from hackers and unwanted mail.","fullDescription":"We all make many online accounts, but most of them are linked to just one or two email addresses. This means if just one account is hacked, every account using the same email address could also be at risk.\n\nFirefox Relay helps you protect your real email address — the one most closely tied to your online identity. It lets you generate unique, random aliases you can use to sign up for accounts, apps, or newsletters, and forwards messages to your real address. If you find that an account is sending unwanted email or spam, you can block the alias and it will stop sending email to your inbox. Once you no longer want an account, you can delete the alias.\n\nWant more protection and convenience? With Firefox Relay Premium you can create unlimited aliases and send replies. Additionally, you can create a custom domain for your aliases that’s easier to remember and share. Need an alias for a restaurant reservation? Just say restaurantname@yourdomain.mozmail.com — no need to create the alias beforehand.\n\nPermissions requested by this add-on and their purpose:\n\nAccess to All Websites (<all_urls>): Our add-on requests access to content from any website you visit.
